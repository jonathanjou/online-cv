career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        I am an interdisciplinary theoretical computer scientist and 
        computational chemist with extensive software engineering training 
        who seeks to transform computer-assisted drug discovery with novel 
        algorithms and practical, user-friendly drug discovery software. I 
        have worked with wet-lab experimentalists and medicinal chemists 
        to perform structure-based drug design, ensemble-based thermodynamic 
        modeling of antibodies and enzymes, and peptide inhibitors, and 
        integrate their experimental data into design choices. As a 
        postdoctoral research associate, I have collaborated with researchers
        and PIs at other institutes, as well as mentored and led teams of 
        graduate students and postdocs to publish multiple publications and 
        design antibodies with novel neutralization activity. I am looking 
        for new opportunities to learn, build skills, and decipher the 
        challenges of computational drug discovery.

      details: |
          - Designed de novo peptides computationally predicted to 
          prevent viral entry of SARS-CoV-2.
          - Developed user-friendly UI plugin for the PyMOL protein 
          structural visualizer to analyze protein interactions and 
          configure protein designs for the OSPREY protein design 
          software suite.
          - Developed and published new algorithms that are up to two 
          orders of magnitude faster and three orders of magnitude more 
          efficient than the state of the art.
          - Applied newly developed algorithms to analyze experimental data
          in greater detail and with novel visualization tools.
          - Mentored and led new PhD students in algorithms development and
          protein design, leading to multiple co-first author publications.
